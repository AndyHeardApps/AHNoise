/**
 Takes the outputs of any class that adheres to the `AHNTextureProvider` protocol and applies a perspective transform.
 
 The `xCompression` property determines how much the upper portion of the input is compressed horizontally to give the impression of stretching into the distance. Values over 3.3 will result in the texture wrapping. A value of 2-2.5 is a good place to start.
 
 The `yScale` property determines how much the input is scaled in the vertical axis to give an impression of looking at the canvas at a shallow angle. This can range from 0.0 - 1.0. at 0.0 the canvas has zero height, at 1.0 it retains its original height.
 
 The `direction` property allows the direction of the perspective to be skewed left (using negative values) or right (using positive values) to give the impression a horizontal receding angle.
 
 Values are interpolated to avoid pixellation.
 
 *Conforms to the `AHNTextureProvider` protocol.*
