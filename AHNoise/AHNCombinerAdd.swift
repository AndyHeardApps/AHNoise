/**
 Combines two input `AHNTextureProvider`s by adding their colour values together.
 
 The input values are added in colour space, and not noise space (0.0 - 1.0 not -1.0 - 1.0) meaning the result should always be at least as "light" as the lightest of the two inputs.
 
 For example a pixel with a noise value of -0.4 [0.3 in colour space] when added to another pixel with a noise value of 0.2 [0.6 in colour space] will result in a noise value of 0.8 [0.9 in colour space].
 
 The `normalise` property indicates whether or not the resulting value (0.6 [0.8] in the above example) should be normalised (divided by two) to return the output the the original value range and preventing output values from exceeding 1.0 [1.0]. Setting this to `true` results in the ouput being the average of the two inputs.
 
 Resultant values larger than 1.0 [1.0] will show as white. The addition is done separately for each colour channel, so the result does not default to greyscale.
