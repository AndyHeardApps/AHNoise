/**
 Combines two input `AHNTextureProvider`s by dividing their colour values by one another.
 
 The input values are divided in colour space, and not noise space (0.0 - 1.0 not -1.0 - 1.0). The value of the output is calculated using: `output = input1.rgb / input2.rgb`.
 
 For example a pixel with a noise value of -0.4 [0.3 in colour space] when divided by another pixel with a noise value of 0.2 [0.6 in colour space] will result in a noise value of 0.0 [0.5 in colour space].
 
 Resultant values larger than 1.0 [1.0] will show as white, and lower than -1.0 [0.0] will show as black. The multiplication is done separately for each colour channel, so the result does not default to greyscale.
